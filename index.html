        </div>
            <p>First of all, be sure you already downloaded Processing from the <a
                    href="https://processing.org/download">official website</a>. Click the link that corresponds to the
                type of computer you’re using. Once the download is over, extract the data
                on a folder of your choice (make it easy to reach, this is where you will launch Processing everytime!).
                Open this folder, and double click on <span class="code_text">processing.exe</span>. A new windows
                should open; this is where you’ll
                be writing your code.</p>

            <p>Similar to how Microsoft Word and Google Docs help you edit text, code editors like this help you write
                code. The Processing editor includes some handy features like syntax highlighting (coloring the text) to
                make it easier to read your code,
                and a play button (the triangular button in the upper-left corner) to make it easier to run your code.

            <div class="code-area">

            <p>When you click the play button, Processing runs the code you just wrote. You should see a window that
                looks like this:</p>

            <img class="img_steps" src="images/step1.png" alt="circle in a canvas">


            <p>In fact, what you wrote on the editor is called <span class="emph">an instruction</span>, or <span
                    class="emph">a function</span>. In other words, you asked to your computer to execute a specific
                action, in that case drawing a circle. We will enter more in details about the numbers in the
                parenthesis you also wrote a bit later, but first, let's try to draw another shape, say a rectangle.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Draw me a rectangle, part I</h3>
            <p>Considering the previous example, we can try to guess what could be such the corresponding instruction.
                Since the previous function was circle to draw a circle, it seems legitimate to try the following code.
                In the editor, type this:</p>

            <div class="code-area wrong">
                <pre>
                    <code >
    rectangle(40, 30, 20, 20); </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                Congratulations, you just had your first programming error in Processing. Don't worry, this is a common
                event in programming.</p>

            <blockquote>Okay, but what just happened?</blockquote>

            <p>
                As mentionned earlier, to ask your computer to draw a rectangle, you need the corresponding instruction.
                We assumed the instruction was <span class="code_text">rectangle</span> (which was a fair guess), but it
                turns out that the correct instruction is
                <span class="code_text">rect</span>. </p>
            <blockquote>Wait, it didn't work just for that?</blockquote>
            <p> Yes, just for that. Without entering into the technical details, the computer is limited to understand
                very specific words and if you do not use these words, it will not work. And somehow, it makes sense: it
                is similar that someone asking you to do a task (no matter how simple it
                is), but in a language you don't know...</p>

            <p>In fact, the software detected that it didn't know the instruction. Indeed, below the editor, you must
                have the following message:</p>


            <img class="img_steps" src="images/error1.png" alt="error message">

            <p>The message explicitely tells you that the program does not recognise the instruction <span
                    class="code_text">rectangle</span> (note: to be precise, it tells you it does not know this
                instruction given <i>with the number wrote in the parenthesis</i>, but for now let us just focus on the
                fact the instruction <span class="code_text">rectangle</span> does not exist). Every time you will have
                a syntax error on your code (Spoiler: this will happen a lot, and this is normal), a message will appear
                here.</p>

            <p>Before finaly drawing our first rectangle, let me show you a very common error in Processing (especially
                for beginners).</p>


            <h3 class="subtitle">Syntax Error - Missing ";"</h3>
            <p>Let us take back our first command we wrote, and remove the final ";". Thus, you should have the
                following:</p>

            <div class="code-area wrong">
                <pre>
                        <code >
    circle(40, 30, 50) </code>
                    </pre>
            </div>

            <p>Similarly as before, this error message appears below the editor:</p>

            <img class="img_steps" src="images/error2.png" alt="error message">

            <blockquote>Okay, indeed but why is it important?</blockquote>

            <p>Well, it is because this is a typo you will do a lot; probably more than you might think. My goal here is
                to teach you how to detect this error, to solve them by yourself. So keep in mind the crucial following
                syntaxic rule:</p>

            <span class="info warning" data-text="Rule: ">Every instruction in Processing ends with a semicolon.</span>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Draw me a rectangle, part II</h3>

            <p>
                Now we finally know the correct instruction for the rectangle, we know what to write on the editor, that
                is:
            </p>
            <div class="code-area">
                <pre>
                    <code >
    rect(40, 30, 20, 20); </code>
                </pre>
                <button class="copy_button" onclick="copyClipboard(this)" onmouseout="outFunc(this)">Copy code</a>
            </div>

            <p>and launch your program by clicking on the play button (or <span class="code_text">Ctrl+R</span>). You
                should have the following result: </p>


            <img class="img_steps" src="images/step2.png" alt="rectangle in a canvas">

            <p>Now, as promised, let us focus a bit on these numbers in parenthesis we wrote several times now.</p>

        </section>


        <section id="section_3">
            <div class="sticky-title">
                <h2 class="title_section">Coordinates and arguments</h2> 
            <div class="progress_bar">
            <div class="progress"></div>
        </div>
        </div>
            Say I give you a sheet of paper, and ask you to draw me a rectangle on it. I have an exact idea of what
            rectangle I want, but all I say to you is "draw me a rectangle".


            <blockquote>Hmmm, I feel like I'm missing piece of information there, no?</blockquote>

            <p>Exactly ! To draw what I have in mind, you need more data: where I want to have the rectangle drawn, what
                is its height, its width, eventually even the angle or its color. These are the informations we give to
                the instruction in the parenthesis: we call them <span class="emph">arguments</span>.</p>



            <p>Now, take a bit of time to change the arguments of the <span class="code_text">rect</span> function, and
                relaunch the code each time. Try to understand which argument corresponds to what. </p>
            <p> If you prefer, you can directly try to change the values with the interactive figure below.</p>


            <div id="rect_div_container" class="interactive_shape_container">
                <div id="rect_div" class="shape_div">
                </div>
                <span class="code_text">rect(<input type="number" name="xI" id="xI" class="input_interactive"
                        value="40">,<input type="number" name="yI" id="yI" class="input_interactive" value="30">,<input
                        type="number" name="wI" id="wI" class="input_interactive" value="20">,<input type="number"
                        name="hI" id="hI" class="input_interactive" value="20">);
                </span>
            </div>

            <span class="info note" data-text="Note: ">There are several interactive figures like the one above. When
                there is one of those, you can change the values of the arguments of the instruction, and the resulted
                canvas will be emulated.</span>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Coordinates</h3>

            <p>With your previous experiments, you may have understood that the two first numbers change the position of
                the rectangle. To be precise, the first number corresponds to the x-coordinates and the second to the
                y-coordinate of the <span class="emph">top-left corner of the rectangle</span>. If the notion of
                coordinates is not super clear for you, here is a figure to help you understand how it works:</p>

            <img src="images/axis1.png" class="img_steps" alt="axis in Processing">

            <p> Suppose that the canvas of your drawing corresponds to the gray area of the previous figure. This canvas
                contains (virtually) two axes: the x-axis that corresponds to the top border of the canvas, and the
                y-axis which is on the left border of the canvas. The x-axis is oriented from left to right, and the
                y-axis is from top to bottom. At each point of the canvas corresponds a unique pair of numbers, called
                <span class="emph">coordinates</span> and is written <span class="emph">(n° of unit on the x-axis, n° of
                    unit on the y-axis)</span>. For exemple, in the figure above, the red point has coordinates (3,1),
                because on the x-axis, its value is 3 and on the y-axis, its value is 1.</p>

            <span class="info note" data-text="Note: ">If you are used to graphs in mathematics, notice that the
                origin
                here is at the top-left corner of the canvas.</span>


            <p>
                You can also see how coordinates work in this interactive figure. Click anywhere on the figure to lock
                the current point.
            </p>

            <div id="ellispe_div_container" class="interactive_shape_container">
                <div id="coord_div" class="shape_div">
                </div>
            </div>



            <p>Here is a small exercise for you:</p>


            <div class="exercise">
                <div class="exercise_title">Exercise</div>

                <div class="exercise_content">
                    <div class="exercise_question"> Here are 3 additional points on the previous figure. Find their
                        coordinates.

                        <div id="exercise_coordinates">
                            <img class="img_steps" src="images/ex_axis.png" alt="option 1">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="exercise_solution">Solution:
                        <p class="spoiler" data-text="Hover me to reveal!"><span>Blue point: (1,-1); Green point:
                                (0,2); Orange point: (4,2)</span></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Note that the axes also continue for negative numbers. Therefore, it is totally possible to have
                coordinates like (-20, -22), but it won't appear on your screen.</p>


            <h3 class="subtitle">Width and height</h3>

            <p>Moving back to the two last arguments of the <span class="code_text">rect</span> instruction, you may
                have understood with your previous experiments that they correspond to the <span
                    class="emph">width</span> and <span class="emph">height</span> of your rectangle. Therefore, we have
                the following syntax.</p>


            <div class="code-area syntax">
                <pre>
                                <code >
    rect(x, y, width, height);</code>
                            </pre>
                <button class="syntax_button">Syntax</a>
            </div>


            <p>We finally can totally decrypt the instructions to draw a rectangle, such as <span
                    class="code_text">rect(50, 10, 20, 30);</span>. The latter asks to your computer to draw a rectangle
                with its top-left corner in coordinates (50,10) and with
                width 20 and height 30.</p>

            <blockquote>Hmm, I'm thinking of this only now, but 30 what? What's the unit?</blockquote>

            <p>Indeed, this is something I didn't mention so far. For distance units, Processing uses the pixel (often
                wrote 'px'). A pixel is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen. To
                simplify, every screen is made of millions
                of small lights of different colors that are on with different intensities. Each of these lights is a
                pixel. We will come back with the notion of pixel soon when we will mention colors! But first, another
                exercise:</p>

            <div class="exercise">

                In addition to rectangles, Processing already created instructions to draw basic forms. We detail here
                the different shapes primitives. Instead of simply reading these instructions, I strongly recommend you
                first try to guess what could be their arguments.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Circle</h3>
            <p>
                We already saw that <span class="code_text">circle</span> was the function to draw... a circle. We can
                also notice that this function takes 3 numbers as arguments. Can you try to guess which corresponds to
                what? In other words, if I ask
                you to draw a circle, what informations would you need?
            </p>

            <div class="code-area syntax">
                <pre>
                        <code >
    circle(x, y, diam);</code>
                    </pre>
                <button class="syntax_button">Syntax</a>
            </div>

            <p>Where <span class="code_text">x</span> and <span class="code_text">y</span> stands for the coordinate of
                the <span class="emph">center of the circle</span>, and <span class="code_text">diam</span> stands for
                its diameter.</p>

            <blockquote>Diameter? Damn I thought about the radius instead...</blockquote>

            <p>And you would have been right! More precisely, it could have had been the radius instead. What was
                important was to guess there was an information needed for the position, and one for the size, like
                previously for <span class="code_text">rect</span>.</p>

            <p>In fact, there are some reasons why one would prefer to put the diameter than the raidus here. In the
                same way that the order of the arguments is <span class="code_text">x, y, diam</span>, and not <span
                    class="code_text">diam, y, x</span> (or any other ordering): consistency.</p>

            <p>
                Remember, for rectangles, it was <span class="code_text">x, y, width, height</span>, that is first the
                position, and then the size informations. For circles, these informations appear in the same order. Do
                you see now why more the diameter than the radius?
            </p>

            <blockquote>Hmm, not really...</blockquote>

            <p>
                Because we can see the diameter of a circle also like its width and height! Therefore, this is
                consistent with the rectangle instruction, as well as our next instruction for the ellipse...
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Ellipse</h3>
            <p>
                Ellipses can be seen as a generalisation of circles with a width and height not necessarily equals. They
                are fairly common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For example, the orbit of each planet in the
                solar system is approximately an ellipse.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are multiple ways to define an ellipse (excentricity, focus points, etc...). In Processing, we
                define an ellipse with the position of its center, and its width and height; see figure below.
            </p>
            <img class="img_steps" src="images/ellipse1.png" alt="ellipse">

            <p>
                Therefore, the correct instruction to draw an ellipse is:
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Line</h3>

            <p>The instruction to draw a line in Processing is fairly straightforward; you just need to give the
                coordinates of the two extremities of the line. Namely, we have:</p>

            <blockquote>Wait, wait, wait... What about the thickness? If I ask you to draw a line, I may expect it to be
                thick or thin !</blockquote>

            <p>Indeed, that's a very good remark ! The creators of Processing could have decided to add an extra
                argument to determine the thickness of a line. However, they decided to deal with it in another way
                we'll see later. Besides, note that this thickness question could also have applied for all the other
                shapes; I could have expected thick strokes for my initial rectangle! But it is true that it is more
                clear that something is missing (Spoiler: another instruction!) to handle the thickness.</p>

            Let us now see the instruction for triangles. If you try to think how you can describe a triangle, you
            may realise there are several ways to do so. However, the easiest way to do so is probably the one used by
            Processing, that is simply describe the coordinates of its three vertices. Therefore, we have the following
            syntax:

            <img class="img_steps" src="images/triangle1.png" alt="triangle">


            <!-- <p>

            <p>Some instructions for basic shapes exist in Processing, such as quadrilaterals or arcs. If you want to
                know more about them, feel free to read their documentation on the official website <a
                    href="https://processing.org/examples/shapeprimitives.html" target="_blanck">here</a>. The idea of
                this section was to introduce you some of them, not being exhaustive.</p>

            <blockquote>What about the non-basic ones? What if I want to draw a star for example?</blockquote>

            <p>Technically, you can see a star as several triangles. For exemple, try the following code:</p>


            <div class="code-area">
                <pre>
                    <code >
    triangle(50,10,20,70,80,70);
    triangle(50,90,80,30,20,30);</code>
                </pre>
                <button class="copy_button" onclick="copyClipboard(this)" onmouseout="outFunc(this)">Copy code</a>
            </div>

            <p>You should obtain the following result:</p>


            <img class="img_steps" src="images/star1.png" alt="first star">

            <blockquote>This is not exactly what I expected. Can I put colors? And these strokes are a bit annoying...
            </blockquote>

            <p>Don't worry for the colors and the stroke, we will see how to handle this in the following section. I
                also understand that this is not exactly what you had in mind. Thus let us see a last instruction that
                allows you to make more complex shapes (like stars, for example).
            </p>


            <h3 class="subtitle">Complex shapes</h3>

            <p>
                Processing create functions to draw polygons of any kind. However, the use is a bit more complex than
                the ones we saw so far.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose I ask you to draw me a polygon that goes through the points of coordinates (20, 20), (80, 20),
                (80, 80), and (20, 80), what will you draw?
            </p>

            <blockquote>Hmm, I'd say it is this square.</blockquote>


            <img class="img_steps" src="images/shape1NoCoord.png" alt="wrong shape">

            <p>Hmm, what if I tell you this is not what I had in mind?</p>

            <blockquote>Eh? Where is the problem?</blockquote>

            <p>What if I tell you this is this shape I had in mind?</p>
            <img class="img_steps" src="images/shape2NoCoord.png" alt="good shape">

            <blockquote>It's absolutely not what you asked me!</blockquote>

            <p>Are you sure? They both go through the exact same vertices, and the ones I told you!</p>

            <div class="container_double_img">
                <img class="img_steps" src="images/shape1.png" alt="good shape">
                <img class="img_steps" src="images/shape2.png" alt="good shape">
            </div>


            <blockquote>You're cheating, the ordering on the vertices you gave me was wrong.</blockquote>

            <p>This is precisely where I wanted you to end up by asking you this question: <span class="emph">the order
                    matters if you define a shape only by its vertices</span>. Note that this could have had happened
                for the <span class="code_text">line</span> and <span class="code_text">triangle</span> instruction,
                since both used positions of their vertices. However, I let you convince yourself that a problem such
                the one we just had cannot happen with less than four vertices.</p>

            <p>Anyway, we can now move to our instructions to define these kind of shapes.</p>

            <blockquote>InstructionS. Plural? </blockquote>

            <p>Yes, this is a triple of instructions: <span class="code_text">beginShape</span>, <span
                    class="code_text">vertex</span>, and <span class="code_text">endShape</span>. In your editor, try
                the following code:</p>


            <div class="code-area">
                <pre>
                    <code>
    beginShape();
    vertex(80, 20);
    vertex(20, 20);
    vertex(80, 80);
    vertex(20, 80);
    endShape(CLOSE);</code>
                </pre>
                <button class="copy_button" onclick="copyClipboard(this)" onmouseout="outFunc(this)">Copy code</a>
            </div>

            <p>You should end up with the figure above, the one I had in mind. Try to change the order of the <span
                    class="code_text">vertex</span> instructions and see how the result changes each time.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Here is precisely how these instructions work.</p>
            <p>First, <span class="code_text">beginShape()</span> tells to Processing you are defining a new complex
                shape. This is the first instruction you have to put when you start to describe such a shape.</p>

            <p>Then, <span class="code_text">vertex(x,y)</span> defines the coordinate of a vertex of the shape. As we
                saw, the ordering matters. You can put as many vertices as you want.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, you finish your shape with <span class="code_text">endShape(CLOSE)</span>.
            </p>

            <blockquote>What does this CLOSE means?</blockquote>

            <p>If you try to remove it from the code of the previous exercise, you should have this:</p>

            <img class="img_steps" src="images/shapeNotClosed.png" alt="shape not closed">

            <p>It just tells Processing to close the figure by adding a final edge from the last vertex of the shape and
                the first one.</p>

            <p>As said previously, these instructions are slightly harder than the ones we saw before. However, they are
                still pretty logical; you can see these instructions as follow: <span
                    class="code_text">beginShape()</span> asks the computer
                to take a pencil. Then, it goes from one <span class="code_text">vertex</span> to the other without
                lifting the pencil. Finally, <span class="code_text">endShape(CLOSE)</span> close the shape, and put
                back the pencil.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Fifty shades of gray</h3>

            <p>
                Imagine you are in a dark room with a flashlight and a white screen in front of you. Suppose that the
                flashlight has a button that allows you to choose its intensity. By projecting the light on the screen,
                and changing the value of its intensity, you'll see all the possible shades of gray: from black when the
                flashlight is totally off, to plain white when it is at its maximum power. You can try to see the
                different shades of gray with the following interactive figure:
            </p>


            <div id="gray_div" class="canvas_div"></div>
            You can change the intensity of the light by clicking and dragging the mouse on the flashlight, or by
            scrolling over it (with Shift pressed).





            <blockquote>First, your black room thing is a bit spooky. Then, what's the point?</blockquote>

            <p>This is how shades of gray work in Processing. Using the instruction <span class="code_text">color</span>
                and an integer between 0 and 255, you can create a gray that goes from plain white to plain black; the
                higher the number, the brighter the color (like the intensity in our spooky scenario).</p>

            <div class="code-area syntax">
                <pre>
                        <code >
    color(n);</code>
                    </pre>
                <button class="syntax_button">Syntax</a>
            </div>

            <p>
                Where <span class="code_text">n</span> stands for a number from 0 to 255.
            </p>

            <blockquote>Why from 0 to 255, and not 0 to 100?</blockquote>

            <p>
                It would require a long explaination to fully answer this intersting question, but there is (obviously)
                a
                reason. At the very base, computers work with binary, that is a way to right information (number,
                letters,
                images, programs...) with only 0s and 1s. Without entering into the details, it implies that we often
                come
                across numbers that are powers of 2, such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and... 256.
            </p>

            <blockquote>Yes, but it's 255...</blockquote>

            <p>
                Correct! But the number of integers from 0 to 255 is 256 (because we have to count the 0)! By the way,
                if you have
                ever played to Minecraft, you may have noticed that the powers of 2 are everywhere (size of a stack,
                highest altitude, etc...). If you never played this game, just ignore this comment !
            </p>


            <blockquote>Okay, fine. But "<span class="code_text">color</span>", really? These gray shades really lack of
                colors to me...
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                I have to admit you are very right! So let us move to real colors!
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">From pixels to RGB</h3>

            <p>
                Have you ever looked in detail at what your screen looks like up close? Well, if not, let me show you
                how it looks like.
            </p>



            <figure>
                <img class="img_steps" src="images/pixels.jpg" alt="pixels closeup">

                <figcaption class="cite_wiki">By Kprateek88 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, <a

                        here</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <blockquote>
                What? No white pixels? Only red, green and blue?
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                No white pixels, but still you seem to see the white, the yellow, the purple, cyan etc from your screen!
                This is because you can decompose every color in a combinaison of shades of red, green and blue.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us come back in our spooky dark room (sorry for that), but this time you have 3 flashlights: one
                red, one green, and one blue. Using the interactive figure below, observe how the lights add up to
                create new colors, including colors not in your three initial colors.
            </p>

            <div id="colors_div" class="canvas_div"></div>

            <p>
                In particular, notice that the color you obtain by putting the three intensities at maximum is... white!
                Spend some time to try to get other colors; how to get yellow, orange, purple?
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, to define a color in Processing, you have to use the following instruction:
            </p>

            <div class="code-area syntax">
                <pre>
                        <code >
    color(r, g, b);</code>
                    </pre>
                <button class="syntax_button">Syntax</a>
            </div>

            <p>
                Where <span class="code_text">r, g, b</span> stand for a number from 0 to 255 corresponding to the level
                of red, green and blue respectively.
            </p>

            <span class="info note" data-text="Note: ">We call RGB value of a color the triple (r,g,b) that corresponds
                to this color.</span>


            <blockquote>
                The instruction <span class="code_text">color</span> is already the one we used for gray. Isn't there a
                problem?
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                No, because Processing can easily understand which calls of <span class="code_text">color</span> are for
                the gray version and the ones for the color version, it just have to check the arguments: if it is only
                one number, it's gray; if it has three numbers, it's the RGB value. There is a lot more to say about how
                we can reuse the same name for a function, but for now we will be limited to this.

            <p>See, we give as an argument of the instruction the color we want to put for the background. As you can
                guess, the first syntax
                will give a shade of gray, and the second a RGB color. </p>

            <p>
                There's hopefully a shorter way to write it, but keep in mind that it is not always the case, and
                instructions can be long to
                write. <br>
                For <span class="code_text">background</span>, here are the shortest versions. Can you guess which

            <p>Correct! Creators of Processing worked well to make it logical, right? Now, let us try to see what it
                gives in action. In the
                editor, try to enter the following code:</p>
